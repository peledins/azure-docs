> [!NOTE]
> The thresholds above are weighted and enforcement is on their sum. You can do 125 RSA-HSM-4k operations and 0 RSA-HSM-2k, or 124 RSA-HSM-4k and 8 RSA-HSM-2k. Afterward, in the same 10-second interval, any other operation will cause an AKV client exception.

> [!NOTE]
> If you look at the table below, you see that for software-backed keys we allow 2000 transactions per 10 seconds, and for HSM backed keys we allow 1000 transactions      per 10 seconds. 
  The ratio of software-backed transactions for 3072 keys to 2048 keys is 500/2000 or 0.4. This means that if a customer does 500 3072 key transactions in 10 seconds, they reach their max limit and can't do any other key operations.

See [Azure Key Vault throttling guidance](../articles/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-throttling.md) for information on how to handle throttling when these limits are exceeded.

<sup>1</sup> There is a subscription-wide limit for all transaction types, that is 5x per key vault limit. For example, HSM- other transactions per subscription are limited to 5000 transactions in 10 seconds per subscription.
